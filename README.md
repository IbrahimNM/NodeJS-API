# NodeJS Simple REST-API

## How to run the server:
1. Run the app.js script:
    ```console
    node app.js
    ```
2. Now, you can use your browser or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to test the server.

## Declared endpoint:
1. '_localhost:3000/_': This is the API home page, accepts only **GET** requests.
2. '_localhost:3000/info_': This endpoint accepts only **GET** requests.
3. '_localhost:3000/students_': This endpoint accepts only **POST** requests.
## Notes:
* The default address is **_localhost:3000_**
* Once you run the server, the server will tell you if any of the endpoints have been called.
